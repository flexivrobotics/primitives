Primitive Introduction
======================
Primitives are robots’ actions/skills that can be used to operate the robot and tools. Users can use a sequence of primitives to define lower-level tasks, such as moving the TCP, applying a contact force, and/or performing higher-level tasks, such as polishing a surface or inserting a connector, etc. Primitives are also the basic building blocks of PLANs, which are typically used for running a complete application. Below is a list of primitive categories:

* [Workflow](Primitives.html#workflow)
* [Motion](Primitives.html#motion)
* [Hybrid Motion/Force](Primitives.html#hybrid-motion-force)
* [Grasping](Primitives.html#grasping)
* [Assembly](Primitives.html#assembly)
* [Tray Loading](Primitives.html#tray-loading)
* [Polishing](Primitives.html#polishing)

**Make sure the following conditions are met for any primitive:**

* The robot is well-calibrated with kinematics calibration, dynamics calibration, and torque sensor offset
* The tool’s weight(if any) should be accurate enough with an error smaller than 100g.
* The robot’s operation should not exceed joint position, velocity, and torque limit
* Waypoints(if any) are within the workspace (i.e. reachable pose).
* During the motion, the robot should maintain a high manipulability (i.e. the robot is not too close to the singular configurations).
